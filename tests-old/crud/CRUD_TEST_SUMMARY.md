## Key Findings

### Features That Work Well
1. **Admin Calendar Events** - Full CRUD cycle with proper cleanup
2. **Admin Navigation** - Most operations work despite UI challenges
3. **Admin Sermons** - Good CRUD support with cleanup

### Features With Limitations
1. **Timeline Posts** - Post creation interface not found
2. **Admin Pages** - Page creation not working as expected
3. **Profile Updates** - Authentication timeout issues

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication Timeouts** - Some tests fail due to auth timing
2. **UI Element Detection** - Buttons and forms not always found
3. **Feature Availability** - Some CRUD features may not be fully implemented

## Cleanup Strategy

All CRUD tests include cleanup mechanisms:

1. **Immediate Cleanup** - Delete operations in the same test
2. **Test Hooks** - `afterAll` hooks for residual cleanup
3. **State Restoration** - Restore original values where possible

## Running CRUD Tests

```bash
# Run all CRUD tests
npx playwright test tests/crud/

# Run specific CRUD test suite
npx playwright test tests/crud/admin-calendar-crud.spec.ts

# Run only non-skipped CRUD tests
npx playwright test tests/crud/ --grep-invert "skip"
```

## Test Categories by Success Rate

1. **Admin Calendar** - 100% working (6/6)
2. **Admin Navigation** - 83% working (5/6)
3. **Admin Sermons** - 80% working (4/5)
4. **Profile Updates** - 50% working (2/4)
5. **Admin Pages** - 33% working (2/6)
6. **Timeline Posts** - 33% working (2/6)

## Recommendations

1. **Enable Missing Features**: Many CRUD operations are limited by missing UI elements
2. **Fix Authentication Issues**: Profile update timeouts need investigation
3. **Timeline UI**: Post creation interface may need different selectors
4. **Admin Pages**: Page creation workflow may be different than expected
5. **Test Data**: Consider adding specific test data fixtures for CRUD operations

## Notes

- All tests include proper cleanup to maintain system state
- Skipped tests are marked clearly with reasons
- Tests are designed to be idempotent (can run multiple times safely)
- Some features may require specific permissions or data setup
