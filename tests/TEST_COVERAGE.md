## Recommendations

1. **Enable More Features**: Many skipped tests indicate features that may not be fully implemented or accessible in the demo environment.

2. **Test Data Setup**: Consider creating test data fixtures for:
   - Sample groups with details
   - Test events in calendar
   - Sample lessons
   - Active service times for check-in

3. **Permission Levels**: Some features may require different user roles (group leader, admin, etc.) for full testing.

4. **Environment Variables**: Consider adding test-specific environment variables to enable/disable certain test categories based on available features.
